If applicable, you will be advised of this at check-in. You will be accommodated in a room of similar or higher standard to that originally booked.\r\n\r\nDue to limited availability at time of booking, we may provide multi-share accommodation for two or more guests in separate rooms. We will do our best to ensure this does not occur, however should this be necessary we will advise you at check-in.\r\nDuring special events, additional terms and conditions may apply. Our cancellation policy is also subject to change during these times.\r\n\r\nAmendment, non-arrival, cancellation and refund charges:\r\nAmendment\r\nRegardless of when you booked, any amendments to your date of arrival cannot be made on the day you are due to arrive.

However, we will fully refund you for subsequent nights.\r\n\r\nIf you do not advise us of your cancellation, the non-arrival clause applies.\r\nCANCEL OR CHANGE A BOOKING\r\nRefunds for cancelled bookings can be redeemed either by:\r\ntransferring the booking to an advance reservation if available but not in the same week as the booking  or being credited back to the original card
