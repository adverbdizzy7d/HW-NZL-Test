{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Possum Lodge","nameEN":"Possum Lodge","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Take it easy at our scenic lakeside lodge. Our space is hidden away in the wee slice of paradise where the Waiau River meets Lake Manapouri. It's a wonderland for nature and wilderness lovers, nestled into a breathtaking Beech forest, and right on the edge of Fiordland National Park. Beautiful birds fill the trees above. Fantastic fish fill the river and lake below. Humble and historical, the accomodation is basic and the property has been a campground for over 100 years.\r\n\r\nBoth the lake and river are just a stone's throw away. Everything in the Manapouri Township is very walkable and bikeable. Take a 5-minute stroll down the river, under the Beech tree canopy, and you will find RealNZ's Doubtful Sound terminal. We can highly recommend taking a trip from there.\r\n\r\nThe main Manapouri beach is a 5-10 minutes walk around the lake and the local bar, cafe, restaurant, and shop are a 3-minute walk up the track.\r\n\r\nThe mighty Kepler Track is a short drive, and Te Anau is a 15 minutes drive.\r\n\r\nThe maximum stay is 31 days.\r\n\r\nAll standard bookings come with free cancellation up to 24 hours before check in. No shows for bookings are subject to being charged up to the amount of your first night's stay.\r\n\r\nOur Check-in is open from 2pm. If the Reception Desk is closed when you arrive, there will be a self check-in envelope left out for you.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"13 Murrell Avenue","address2":"","city":{"id":4364,"name":"Te Anau","nameEN":"Te Anau"},"country":{"id":151,"name":"New Zealand","nameEN":"New Zealand"},"region":{"id":138,"name":"Southland","nameEN":"Southland"},"latitude":"-45.5664660","longitude":"167.6045420","distance":{"kilometers":19.01,"miles":11.81}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":95,"location":100,"staff":100,"atmosphere":95,"clean":95,"facilities":95,"value":100,"overall":97,"ratingsCount":85},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"","additionalTerms":"","typesNotAccepted":[],"remainderDue":"ONARR","ageRangesAccepted":["0-12","12-18","18-21","21-35","35-50","50+"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":9},"currency":"NZD","houseRules":{"notes":"The maximum stay is 31 days.\r\nCheck in from 2pm onward.
