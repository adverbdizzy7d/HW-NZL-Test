We will send you an email with 'late arrival instructions' on the evening of your arrival day. Please use the free e.g. airport Wi-Fi to check for this information before arrival.\r\n\r\nCheck-out time is by 10 AM.\r\nPlease have packed all your belongings, collected all food from the kitchen and dropped off your key and pillow case at reception before 10 AM.\r\nYou will need to leave the hostel at 10 AM so our staff can clean and prepare the hostel for new guests arriving from 2:30 PM.\r\n\r\nGuests can however still leave bags in our bag room until 4 PM but will need to leave the hostel and return to collect your bags. \r\nAlternatively, guests can pay a $20.00 day fee after checkout and use Attic's common areas until 6 PM. Normal checkout applies and bags still need to be left in the bag room.\r\n\r\nAttic's cleaning and housekeeping teams work between 8.30 AM and 2 PM to ensure all guests can enjoy a clean hostel and rooms. Please help our team by checking out on time and letting them clean each area quickly and efficiently eg the kitchen is closed for cleaning between 10-12 noon. We work hard to ensure all guests can enjoy a clean hostel by 2.30 pm checkin time. Thank you for respecting this policy.\r\n\r\nCancellation Policy:\r\nAny cancellations made within 72 hours will be charged 100%.\r\n\r\nTerms:\r\nPlease note there is 3% credit card fee on all credit or foreign cards.\r\nPhoto ID required.

Guests aged 10-18 will not be permitted to share dormitories with persons other than the members of their booking party. Guests aged 10-18 must be accompanied by a responsible adult (Aged 25+) at all times.\r\nAll guests are encouraged to keep the hostel safe and secure for fellow guests.\r\n\r\nAttic is a social but not a party hostel and quiet time after 11 PM is requested in the hostel so other guests can sleep. As such, we do allow a social drink of BYO alcohol to be consumed on site but please consume responsibly, follow the House Rules and/or the requirements of Attic Team Members when prompted.\r\nNo curfew applies and there are plenty of local bars and entertainment areas nearby due to our CBD location.\r\n\r\nAttic is proud of our close relationship with Hostelworld and we look forward to hosting you.","checkin":{"from":14,"until":23},"latestCheckout":"10:00","policies":["TAXESINCLUDED"],"cancellationPolicy":{"canxDays":3,"freeCancellationEnabled":true}},"taxes":[],"hoscars":{"awards":[{"year":2025,"other":"Oceania","place":5,"otherLabel":"Continent","key":"HOSCARCONTINENTWINNER","priority":8},{"year":2019,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2018,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2017,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10},{"year":2016,"other":"Auckland","place":1,"otherLabel":"City","key":"HOSCARMOSTPOPULAR","priority":10}],"nominations":[]},"facilities":[{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFREE","id":1,"facilities":[{"id":90,"name":"FREEWIFI"},{"id":103,"name":"FREEINTERNETACCESS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYGENERAL","id":2,"facilities":[{"id":113,"name":"JOBSBOARD"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSERVICES","id":3,"facilities":[{"id":15,"name":"LUGGAGESTORAGE"},{"id":153,"name":"RECEPTIONLIMITEDHOURS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYENTERTAINMENT","id":5,"facilities":[{"id":4,"name":"INTERNETACCESS"},{"id":79,"name":"BOOKEXCHANGE"},{"id":95,"name":"BOARDGAMES"},{"id":106,"name":"CABLETV"},{"id":133,"name":"WIFI"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFOODANDDRINKS","id":4,"facilities":[{"id":86,"name":"VENDINGMACHINES"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYKITCHEN","id":6,"facilities":[{"id":92,"name":"KITCHEN"},{"id":99,"name":"COOKER"},{"id":101,"name":"UTENSILS"},{"id":124,"name":"MICROWAVE"},{"id":360,"name":"POTSANDPANS"},{"id":361,"name":"SINK"},{"id":362,"name":"STOVE"},{"id":363,"name":"TOASTER"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYACCESSIBILITY","id":7,"facilities":[{"id":27,"name":"ELEVATOR"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYLAUNDRY","id":8,"facilities":[{"id":5,"name":"LAUNDRYFACILITIES"},{"id":102,"name":"DRYER"},{"id":131,"name":"WASHINGMACHINE"},{"id":368,"name":"FREEIRONIRONINGBOARD"},{"id":369,"name":"RECYCLINGBINS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYWELLNESS","id":9,"facilities":[{"id":81,"name":"HOTSHOWERS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYOUTDOORS","id":10,"facilities":[{"id":107,"name":"OUTDOORTERRACE"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSAFETYANDSECURITY","id":11,"facilities":[{"id":14,"name":"LOCKERS"},{"id":375,"name":"CCTVINCOMMONAREAS"},{"id":376,"name":"FIREEXTINGUISHERS"},{"id":377,"name":"FIRSTAIDKITS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSOCIALAREAS","id":12,"facilities":[{"id":24,"name":"COMMONROOM"},{"id":380,"name":"LOUNGEROOM"},{"id":381,"name":"SOCIALBALCONY"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYBEDROOM","id":13,"facilities":[{"id":9,"name":"LINENINCLUDED"},{"id":132,"name":"TOWELSNOTINCLUDED"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYAVAILABLEFORAFEE","id":15,"facilities":[{"id":13,"name":"TOWELSFORHIRE"},{"id":37,"name":"BREAKFASTNOTINCLUDED"}]}],"images":[{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/cxj3hrcpwyw0g00uapi5","position":1},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/wyvlmiiomkleugmj2fpf","position":2},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/k2qxiev3e85ncaapweb7","position":3},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/xgtmopnhdn7kh8vkel3v","position":4},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/uyble7engrhmmlbicp3n","position":5},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/amiy1aya7hcabwvja2of","position":6},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/xa1sizahc1z7mkqxk8lt","position":7},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/levtertikczcybprxngn","position":8},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/dltkgylg985ebrak8qfx","position":9},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/hexqdxvs9wygbxzuah3n","position":10},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/tpzkcxyfwpmgvsglyrt3","position":11},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/abdg5m27ampqeuq3t9j0","position":12},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/petzhhy0htlb6bn5gf9g","position":13},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/dprgdoktreuzn19ndjsu","position":14},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/tljj5w5dpjamgnbbuw3r","position":15},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/u3yts067xbqynuzo87b8","position":16},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/8/80809/k1gmpwgt3agdx0ttlqsg","position":17},{"prefix":"a
