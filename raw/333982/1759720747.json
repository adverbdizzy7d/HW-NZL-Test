You will be made aware of this in your formal confirmation email, which you will receive after your reservation has been lodged. \r\n\r\nCheck-in\r\nCheck-in starts from 2pm\r\nAs we are a small hostel, our reception is open from 8.30am to 7.30pm.\r\nNew arrivals may arrive any time after 9.00am.  While beds are not ready until 2pm, you can securely store your luggage until your bed is available. \r\n\r\nLate check-ins are only possible with prior notice up to, but no later, than 11:00pm.\r\nIf you will arrive between 7.30pm-11pm, please email or call us 2-3 days before you arrive, and we will provide instructions on how to self-check-in.\r\n\r\nCheck-out\r\nStandard check out time is 10:00am. \r\nWe are happy to store your luggage in our locker room, free of charge, and for you to make use our facilities throughout the day.\r\n\r\nGuests wishing to take advantage of our late check out service can do so for an additional $10.00 per person, or $20 per private room. This gives you the ability to snooze in up to 13:00. This service is subject to availability and must be arranged before 7pm on the night before check-out\r\n\r\nCancellation policy\r\nReservations not cancelled by 0:00am, two calendar days prior to the scheduled arrival date will be subject to additional charges equivalent to one night’s accommodation. For example, if your reservation begins on Wednesday 6th, you would need to cancel on or before 11:59pm on Monday 4th \r\n\r\nFailure to arrive on selected check-in date will result in reservation cancellation. Any applicable fees will be charged remotely. Please notify us of any delays or amendments to your journey as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAll outstanding payments for the duration of your stay are to be paid on arrival (check-in) at the hostel or the beginning of any extension of bookings.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we will provide free cancellation if in the unlikely event the NZ Government closes international borders preventing travel. We do not offer free cancellation to anyone unable to travel due to sickness (Covid 19 or other) or weather disruptions (this is the domain of travel insurance).\r\n\r\nPayment\r\nAll outstanding payment is due on arrival at the hostel, at the date at which your booking begins, or on the commencement of any extension of stay. \r\n\r\nGuests specifying that they will arrive after our reception closes may be charged in advance, this includes bookings between 1-2 nights and any reservations that fall over special events such as New Years Eve, Christmas.   \r\n\r\nPayment is to be made in cash (New Zealand Dollars), or by credit or debit cards. Any payments made using a credit card, travel card or an  international debit card or will incur a 2.5% surcharge – to cover the cost of processing international transactions, which is passed onto us by our bank.  Adventure Hostel does not accept AMEX, Diners or Maestro cards. \r\n\r\nBeds and Room allocation\r\nAdventure Hostels are unable to guarantee guests from a group booking (2+ persons) will be allocated into the same room, as this is dependent on current availability on the date you make your booking. Priority is given to the bookings made earliest.\r\n\r\nNor can we guarantee that any booking will be in the same room for the duration of the stay, though we will always try our best as it makes our job far easier. In the event you may need to shift rooms we will make your stay as smooth and effortless as possible.\r\n\r\nAdventure Hostels do not allocate bunks and operates a first in first choice policy, therefore we are unable to offer any preferred choice between upper or lower bunks.\r\n\r\nAll of our bunks include bed linens, freshly laundered, made-up and ready for you to hop straight into. Towels are also included as standard. Please note, that sleeping bags and external blankets are not permitted to be used for hygiene purposes. All of our rooms feature heat pumps & A/C however, if required, we can provide additional blankets free of charge.\r\n\r\nGroups\r\nAdventure Hostels are small, intimate hostels and therefore do not allow groups of more than 6 people. \r\nThis is to keep the atmosphere for our predominately solo-traveller guests fresh and exciting. Groups can negatively impact the inviting and welcoming nature of a hostel. Unfortunately, anyone found to be making multiple bookings to attempt having more than 6 people will have their booking cancelled or be turned away at check-in.\r\n\r\nMaximum length of stay\r\nAdventure Hostels operate with maximum lengths of stay for all guests. This policy changes dependent on the season (Summer, Nov-April & Winter, June-October)\r\n\r\nSummer – 10 nights.\r\nWinter – 21 nights (solo guests only)\r\n\r\nThere must then be a 20 night break/gap between any subsequent or future reservations at the same Adventure Hostel. We reserve the right to cancel or refuse service to any person making additional bookings within the 20 night break period, or persons who attempt to circumvent our maximum stay policy. \r\n\r\nAdventure Hostels do not provide long-term accommodation or offer weekly rates. \r\n\r\nAge policies\r\nAdventure Hostels does not operate with maximum age policies, however we do have a minimum age policy at our properties. \r\nGuests aged 17 and under (defined as a Child), cannot reside in a mixed dorm with guests that are not associated with their booking. This means that the guest will need to reside in a privately booked dormitory or opt for our Double/Queen-bed room.  \r\n\r\nWe do not need parental permission. Please note however that we allow guests to consume their own alcohol on-site, which is not supervised by Adventure Hostel staff. \r\n\r\nNoise policies\r\nAdventure Hostels operate an unenforced policy of  ‘lights out, no noise’ after 10pm.\r\n\r\nWe operate small hostels, that makes running a 24 hour reception desk unsustainable for the size of our business.\r\nWe rely on the empathy, consideration and cooperation of our guests to act responsibly when on-site, or returning from adventures in the late evenings. \r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that backpacker hostels are inherently social spaces, some level of noise is to be expected. Our hostels are designed to bring travellers together in a social setting, alcohol purchased off-site is welcome and tolerated at our properties when consumed responsibly. Adventure Hostels however, will not tolerate any guest who intentionally or directly creates a negative experience for others. \r\nManagement will act accordingly in such scenarios. \r\n\r\nFor guests in Taupo, late night noise is also to be expected, given the destinations focus on nightlife. No refunds will be offered to guests reporting noise issues involving other guests.","checkin":{"from":14,"until":19},"latestCheckout":"10:00","policies":["CREDITCARDSNOTACCEPTED","NONSMOKING","TAXESINCLUDED"],"cancellationPolicy":{"canxDays":2,"freeCancellationEnabled":true}},"taxes":[],"hoscars":{"awards":[],"nominations":[]},"facilities":[{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFREE","id":1,"facilities":[{"id":90,"name":"FREEWIFI"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYGENERAL","id":2,"facilities":[{"id":78,"name":"ADAPTORS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSERVICES","id":3,"facilities":[{"id":15,"name":"LUGGAGESTORAGE"},{"id":116,"name":"PARKING"},{"id":121,"name":"HOUSEKEEPING"},{"id":153,"name":"RECEPTIONLIMITEDHOURS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYENTERTAINMENT","id":5,"facilities":[{"id":4,"name":"INTERNETACCESS"},{"id":84,"name":"PLAYSTATION"},{"id":95,"name":"BOARDGAMES"},{"id":133,"name":"WIFI"},{"id":384,"name":"GAMINGCONSOLES"},{"id":386,"name":"SMARTTV"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYFOODANDDRINKS","id":4,"facilities":[{"id":29,"name":"BBQ"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYKITCHEN","id":6,"facilities":[{"id":92,"name":"KITCHEN"},{"id":98,"name":"DISHWASHER"},{"id":99,"name":"COOKER"},{"id":100,"name":"FRIDGEFREEZER"},{"id":101,"name":"UTENSILS"},{"id":124,"name":"MICROWAVE"},{"id":359,"name":"KETTLE"},{"id":360,"name":"POTSANDPANS"},{"id":361,"name":"SINK"},{"id":362,"name":"STOVE"},{"id":363,"name":"TOASTER"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYLAUNDRY","id":8,"facilities":[{"id":5,"name":"LAUNDRYFACILITIES"},{"id":369,"name":"RECYCLINGBINS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYWELLNESS","id":9,"facilities":[{"id":81,"name":"HOTSHOWERS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSAFETYANDSECURITY","id":11,"facilities":[{"id":14,"name":"LOCKERS"},{"id":375,"name":"CCTVINCOMMONAREAS"},{"id":378,"name":"SMOKEALARMS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYSOCIALAREAS","id":12,"facilities":[{"id":24,"name":"COMMONROOM"},{"id":381,"name":"SOCIALBALCONY"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYBEDROOM","id":13,"facilities":[{"id":9,"name":"LINENINCLUDED"},{"id":50,"name":"AIRCONDITIONING"},{"id":87,"name":"TOWELSINCLUDED"},{"id":111,"name":"READINGLIGHT"},{"id":119,"name":"HAIRDRYERS"},{"id":382,"name":"CHARGINGPLUGS"}]},{"name":"FACILITYCATEGORYAVAILABLEFORAFEE","id":15,"facilities":[{"id":37,"name":"BREAKFASTNOTINCLUDED"}]}],"images":[{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/vtpfbvh4fkrnyrvhhky7","position":1},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/lxpvitd5z6lp2txx1sl2","position":2},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/xnvva2cvudkblp4gtzpq","position":3},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/bp2uoaysiazno8fx9prk","position":4},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/saziebp5rk03pwjv3twj","position":6},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/mm9f7tkycktklzbjw0yi","position":7},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/rxzhvliylzmixpnzghtb","position":8},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/ahgvlay0gp66yczfpvbt","position":9},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/xcseano5jwqyvepyu3ki","position":10},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/mplmpvgbik0b8t4pdusg","position":11},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/mkudeolre5h7ebhg9s9c","position":12},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/i2zuguvbiwknkz2jmion","position":13},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/gw19tqt3c3qk6xr6jq3q","position":14},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/uinj8wtcnwyq5mgw00jj","position":15},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/ow4tqjebvr4myl2xndhf","position":16},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/b90izmr0v9wnznhhzqhy","position":17},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/rigmd7feovvzpbg3a2fi","position":18},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/vle2ycssu8atnnnqut1b","position":19},{"prefix":"a.hwstatic.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto","suffix":"/v1/propertyimages/3/333982/i058cu9eoqvvut4ekaz6","position":20}],"videos":[],"video":null,"payments":{"payNow":false},"paymentMethods":["PayPal","AliPay","Visa","Mastercard","VisaDebit","Electron","Maestro","JCB"],"hostelworldRecommends":false,"isElevateProperty":false,"hasExperiences":false,"timesBookedToday":0,"promotions":[],"categories":[{"group_category_id":"STAIRCASE_TO_SUSTAINABILITY","group_catego
