{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Kinloch Wilderness Retreat","nameEN":"Kinloch Wilderness Retreat","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Nestled next to Lake Whakatipu at the foot of the mountains, we're a wilderness lodge for those looking to get back to nature and escape the towns. Hosting guests since 1868, we provide all the modern conveniences such as a fully equipped kitchen, TV room, book exchange, communal lounge and bbq whilst in a remote setting. For true relaxation the hot tub with stunning views is a must. \r\n\r\nOur cosy historic restaurant provides a selection of local beers and wines, delicious home cooked fare and stunning views from the outdoor seating. Serving breakfast through to dinner, with drinks available throughout the day. We can pack up a lunch for you to take out for your adventures if you need.\r\n\r\nWe offer track transport to nearby walks and provide luggage storage as well as a wet gear room for trampers. Fishing rods and bikes are available to hire and in the warmer months we offer kayak trips with a guide. Happy to help with any tour bookings and advice.\r\n\r\nOur on-site facilities are available to our departing guests after 10:00 a.m. though facilities may be closed for cleaning around 11:30 a.m.\r\nFacilities are for in-house guests only. Visiting friends of guests are welcome to be entertained in our restaurant. Guests are not to monopolise shared facilities to the exclusion of others.\r\n\r\nThe hot tub may be closed for short periods for water treatment. It will periodically be closed for a 24 hour period to drain, refill & reheat and so use of the hot tub cannot be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThere is a general quieten down time on site of 10pm. At this time we ask guests to turn down the stereo in the communal lounge & also the TV room. Guests need to have consideration for other guests, especially young children who are trying to sleep in their rooms and not congregate outside of rooms.\r\nExcessive noise or anti social behaviour will not be tolerated at any time. Where your behaviour is such that other guests have to be recompensed, or leave early, the cost will be passed on to yourself.\r\n\r\nThe BBQs, tables, chairs, benches, sunshades etc. that we provide on site should be left in position. Guests are not permitted to bring their own furniture or BBQs onto site.\r\n\r\nVehicles should be parked in the designated areas. Your personal possessions are at all times your own responsibility. This is regardless of whether items are in a locked room, communal area or in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAccommodation providers recognize that general wear & tear, minor breakages & regular cleaning are part of the business they operate. The cost to remedy loss or damage or cleansing beyond this level will be passed on to the persons responsible.\r\n\r\nCancellations made more than 30 days prior to stay incur no fee. Cancellations incur a 50% fee up to 30-7 days before stay, after which 100% of the booking will be charged. Cards will be charged for all bookings 7 days prior to staying and will incur a 2.7% processing fee (as do bookings through our website).\r\n\r\nBed and Room Movements\r\n\r\nWhilst every endeavour will be made to ensure you are accommodated in the same room throughout your stay, due to limited availability at time of booking, it may be necessary for you to change rooms. If applicable, you will be advised of this at check-in. You will be accommodated in a room of similar or higher standard to that originally booked. \r\nDue to limited availability at time of booking, multi-share accommodation for two or more guests may be provided in separate rooms. Every endeavour will be made to ensure this does not occur, but should this be necessary you will be advised at check-in.","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"862 Kinloch Road","address2":"","city":{"id":9608,"name":"Glenorchy","nameEN":"Glenorchy"},"country":{"id":151,"name":"New Zealand","nameEN":"New Zealand"},"region":{"id":266,"name":"Otago","nameEN":"Otago"},"latitude":"-44.8434983","longitude":"168.3487944","distance":{"kilometers":3.17,"miles":1.97}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":94,"location":97,"staff":89,"atmosphere":89,"clean":86,"facilities":89,"value":77,"overall":89,"ratingsCount":50},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"There is a general quieten down time on site of 10pm.
