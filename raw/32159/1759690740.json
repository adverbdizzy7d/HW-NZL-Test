{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Mountain View Backpackers Wanaka","nameEN":"Mountain View Backpackers Wanaka","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"We are a small, friendly, and cosy hostel with 30 beds converted from a 1930’s home. We are perfectly located, just a two-minute walk from the centre of town and beautiful Lake Wanaka. \r\n\r\nOne of our most favourite and popular features is our garden, where you will find fresh herbs and at certain times of the year home-grown vegetables. Open to everyone to help themselves.\r\n\r\nOur friendly staff are from all over the world (usually they start as guests and just never want to leave) and you will find more about who is scrubbing your toilet and making your bed on our “who we are board”.  It also includes photos of Buddy and Kiera, the cats who have adopted us and are often found sleeping on the couch or demanding more food (they meow as if they are starving!!). There are also photos of Paige, Graham and family – the local pet kunekune pigs we feed. \r\n\r\nOur staff also love to help you plan your time here. Chill out by the lake, climb Roy’s Peak, catch at movie at the famous Paradiso Cinema, visit the lavender farm, go hiking. There is also many adrenaline activities available including endless bike trails (why not try Heli-biking?) skiing, mountaineering, sky diving or even canyoning. In fact Wanaka has the highest Via Ferrata in the world (where you climb up a waterfall) and one of the only places you can fly a plane whilst soaring over the glaciers… yes you as the pilot!\r\n\r\nWanaka is the perfect base for exploring and has something for everyone – Ask Hayley at reception who has done pretty much every activity in town, and she is happy to share some local secrets.\r\n\r\nPlease remember to always included your mobile number when booking so we can contact you if you have not arrived before reception closes** Check in is from 2pm until 5.00 pm.
