If a card declines, you’ll have time to update it (12 hours, or 2 hours for same-day bookings).\r\n\r\n* Arriving late? No worries. Just make sure you book for the correct date if you’ll be arriving after midnight.\r\n\r\n* House respect: Charges may apply for no-shows, late cancellations, damage, smoking/vaping indoors, or anything that disturbs fellow guests.\r\n\r\nWhy Stay With Us?\r\n\r\nBecause no one ever forgets their first night in jail.\r\n\r\nBOOK YOUR STAY.
