If no extra pods are available, one guest will need to vacate the property, and no refunds will be given if all guests choose to leave. If more than one person does share a pod beyond the available beds and room occupancy, that additional person will be charged the full price for the bed. If payment cannot be taken from the additional person who slept in the guest's bed, the reservation allocated to that bed will be charged instead. \n\nWe have private rooms available for couples.\n\n9.

What is the best way to get to/from the airport from Tahuna Pod Hostel?\n\nAIRPORT TO HOSTEL (BUS)\n\nThe best way to get to the hostel from the Queenstown Airport is to catch the #1 bus from the airport to the Stanley Street Bus Hub. We are then a short 3-minute away. This bus departs from the airport every 15 minutes from 6:15am - 12:15am (midnight). A one-way ticket will cost $10 (cash only, paid to the driver) unless you purchase a reloadable 'Bee Card' for $10 ($5 card purchase, $5 credit) which can then be used for multiple bus rides. You can purchase a Bee Card at the airport from a store called Paper Plus, or from the bus driver but payment can only be with cash for this option. If you have a Bee Card, a one-way bus ride will then cost $2. \n\nHOSTEL TO AIRPORT (BUS)\n\nTo go to the airport from the hostel, you can catch the #1 bus from the Stanley Street Bus Hub, a 3-minute walk from the hostel.
