This service is subject to availability and must be arranged before 7pm on the night before check-out\r\n\r\nCancellation policy\r\nAll standard bookings require a 48 hour notice. \r\nFor no shows, you may be charged up to the amount of your first nights stay.\r\n\r\nFailure to arrive on selected check-in date will result in reservation cancellation. Any applicable fees will be charged remotely. Please notify us of any delays or amendments to your journey as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAll outstanding payments for the duration of your stay are to be paid on arrival (check-in) at the hostel or the beginning of any extension of bookings.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we will provide free cancellation if in the unlikely event the NZ Government closes international borders preventing travel. We do not offer free cancellation to anyone unable to travel due to sickness (Covid 19 or other) or weather disruptions (this is the domain of travel insurance).\r\n\r\nPayment\r\nAll outstanding payment is due on arrival at the hostel, at the date at which your booking begins, or on the commencement of any extension of stay. \r\n\r\nPayment is to be made in cash (New Zealand Dollars), or by credit or debit cards. Any payments made using an international debit card will incur a 2.5% surcharge  to cover the cost of processing international transactions, which is passed onto us by our bank.  Adventure Hostel does not accept AMEX, Diners or Maestro cards. \r\n\r\nBeds and Room allocation\r\nAdventure Hostels are unable to guarantee guests from a group booking (2+ persons) will be allocated into the same room, as this is dependent on current availability on the date you make your booking. Priority is given to the bookings made earliest.\r\n\r\nNor can we guarantee that any booking will be in the same room for the duration of the stay, though we will always try our best as it makes our job far easier. In the event you may need to shift rooms we will make your stay as smooth and effortless as possible.\r\n\r\nAdventure Hostels do not allocate bunks and operates a first in first choice policy, therefore we are unable to offer any preferred choice between upper or lower bunks.\r\n\r\nAll of our bunks include bed linens, freshly laundered, made-up and ready for you to hop straight into. Towels are also included as standard. Please note, that sleeping bags and external blankets are not permitted to be used for hygiene purposes. All of our rooms feature heat pumps & A/C however, if required, we can provide additional blankets free of charge.\r\n\r\nGroups\r\nAdventure Hostels are small, intimate hostels and therefore do not allow groups of more than 6 people. \r\nThis is to keep the atmosphere for our predominately solo-traveller guests fresh and exciting. Groups can negatively impact the inviting and welcoming nature of a hostel. Unfortunately, anyone found to be making multiple bookings to attempt having more than 6 people will have their booking cancelled or be turned away at check-in.\r\n\r\nMaximum length of stay\r\nAdventure Hostels operate with maximum lengths of stay for all guests. This policy changes dependent on the season (Summer, Nov-April & Winter, June-October)\r\n\r\nSummer  10 nights.\r\nWinter  21 nights (solo guests only)\r\n\r\nThere must then be a 20 night break/gap between any subsequent or future reservations at the same Adventure Hostel. We reserve the right to cancel or refuse service to any person making additional bookings within the 20 night break period, or persons who attempt to circumvent our maximum stay policy. \r\n\r\nAdventure Hostels do not provide long-term accommodation or offer weekly rates. \r\n\r\nAge policies\r\nAdventure Hostels does not operate with maximum age policies, however we do have a minimum age policy at our properties. \r\nGuests aged 17 and under (defined as a Child), cannot reside in a mixed dorm with guests that are not associated with their booking. This means that the guest will need to reside in a privately booked dormitory or opt for our Double/Queen-bed room.  \r\n\r\nWe do not need parental permission. Please note however that we allow guests to consume their own alcohol on-site, which is not supervised by Adventure Hostel
