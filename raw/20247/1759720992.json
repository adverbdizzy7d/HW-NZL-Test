{"type":"HOSTEL","name":"Braemar House B&B and YHA Hostel","nameEN":"Braemar House B&B and YHA Hostel","isActive":true,"isNew":false,"description":"Braemar House (built 1880) B&B and YHA Hostel is a restored historic homestead located on the banks of the Whanganui River. We have FREE unlimited high-speed wifi and provide a wide range of accommodation options to suit all budgets including Deluxe Private Rooms in our historic Bed and Breakfast wing, great value private Family/Group, Double or Twin Cabin options, or an affordable bunk-bed in our shared Hostel Dorms.\n\nOur B&B wing has 7 unique private rooms with 5 double and 3 twin room options, some rooms with garden views and some with access to the front veranda where you can enjoy a good book or morning coffee with views of the garden. Bathrooms are shared in this wing with three toilets, two showers and a bath there are plenty of options even if you decide to book the whole wing for a group. The B&B wing also has its own private lounge and dining room for you to enjoy. On occasions B&B guests can access the YHA hostel kitchen but must give way to hostel guests. \n\nOur private Cabins and hostel Dorm rooms (YHA) are spotlessly clean, as is our hostel lounge and adjoining communal hostel kitchen with plenty of space and equipment to prepare your meals and space for food storage. In season you can pick a variety of fresh fruits such as delicious grapefruit from the trees and you may also have some extra vegetables from our excellent vegetable garden. We have a very comfortable laid-back hostel and if you want to unwind, totally relax, sunbathe in the garden, grab a book from our library or book swap shelf, or watch TV and feel at home, then this is the place for you. \n\nWe are just a five-minute walk to plenty of tourist attractions, great restaurants and cafes, and 15-minute walk from the main street, Victoria Avenue. We are centrally heated in winter and free parking is available in the wide street, directly in front of Braemar House.\n\nWe have in house access to Hostel International/YHA forward booking facilities and YHA travel desk. The Paddle Steamer Waimarie passes daily in front of the Hostel in Summer, while the famous Mail Run Tours pick up daily from the Hostel. The Volcanic Plateau and Skifields (Turoa) are approximately 1-1/2 hours driving from Wanganui.\n\nBed and Room Movements\n\nWhilst every endeavour will be made to ensure you are accommodated in the same room throughout your stay, due to limited availability at time of booking, it may be necessary for you to change rooms. If applicable, you will be advised of this at check-in. You will be accommodated in a room of similar or higher standard to that originally booked. \nDue to limited availability at time of booking, multi-share accommodation for two or more guests may be provided in separate rooms. Every endeavour will be made to ensure this does not occur, but should this be necessary you will be advised at check-in.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Braemar House!","hostelworldSays":null,"hostelSays":null,"location":{"address1":"2 Plymouth Street Wanganui 4500","address2":"","city":{"id":10101,"name":"Whanganui","nameEN":"Whanganui"},"country":{"id":151,"name":"New Zealand","nameEN":"New Zealand"},"region":{"id":666,"name":"Manawatu-Wanganui","nameEN":"Manawatu-Wanganui"},"latitude":"-39.9235880","longitude":"175.0510900","distance":{"kilometers":0.93,"miles":0.58}},"maxGuestsPerBooking":8,"depositPercentage":15,"ratings":{"security":91,"location":86,"staff":94,"atmosphere":86,"clean":86,"facilities":71,"value":89,"overall":86,"ratingsCount":153},"groupInformation":{"listingInfo":"","terms":"","cancellationTerms":"","additionalTerms":"","typesNotAccepted":["STAGHENBACHELORPARTY"],"remainderDue":"ONARR","ageRangesAccepted":["0-12","12-18","18-21","21-35","35-50","50+"],"maxGuestsPerBooking":14},"currency":"NZD","houseRules":{"notes":"Linen is provided for all rooms and complimentary towels are provided for all private Deluxe B&B wing rooms and private Economy Cabins.
